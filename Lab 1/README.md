This is a map of some hikes my friends and I would like to do in Whistler this summer. When considering which hikes we would like to do, we wanted to ensure that there is free parking nearby, and as we have Whistler passes which allow us free access to the gondolas in the summer, we are curious to see which hikes we can do after taking the gondola up. Therefore, in addition to the data on trails, I added free parking close to the trails and the main gondolas from the base to the top of the mountains. I added the gondola data myself through editing the dataset, and filtered both the trail data and the parking data to contain only my desired data. 

When creating the map, I used a variation of the "Outdoors" base layer map as when zoomed in it demonstrates contour lines and elevation to see the elevation gains on different hikes, and when zoomed out it shows the steepness of the mountains. The trails are the top layer on the map as they are the key feature I'm highlighting. I tried to make them stand out with the thicker lines and purple colour that is very different from the background, and had the gondola in dotted black and the parking lots in orange so they blended in with the surroundings a bit more. All features are visible at different zoom levels, and the title and legend stay in place as you zoom in and out. I could improve my map by adding labels to the trails which could include the trail name, and average time to complete it. ![image](https://github.com/rachelhabermehl/rachelhabermehl-web/assets/156623295/46e25fb0-9fa3-40c8-a0ab-5827f0176752)
